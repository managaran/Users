# Users

Learning Objectives:

Students will create databases using the three types of relationships.
Students will use SQL queries.
In the previous chapter, you created users_schema. Now, you'll get the chance to forward engineer this schema, and use queries to manipulate the database.


If you get stuck on retrieving, changing, sorting, or deleting users, be sure to apply the 20 minute rule! Try re-reading the previous modules and doing research on your own, then reaching out to your peers on Discord, and finally setting up some time with a Coding Dojo staff member so that you talk through the challenge you're facing.

Forward engineer the users_schema you created in the previous chapter

Create a .txt file where you'll save each of the queries you'll run in the workbench

Query: Create 3 new users

Query: Retrieve all the users

Query: Retrieve the first user using their email address

Query: Retrieve the last user using their id

Query: Change the user with id=3 so their last name is Pancakes

Query: Delete the user with id=2 from the database

Query: Get all the users, sorted by their first name

BONUS Query: Get all the users, sorted by their first name in descending order

Submit your .txt file that contains all the queries you ran in the workbench
